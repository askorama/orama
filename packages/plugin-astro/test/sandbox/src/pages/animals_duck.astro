    <h1>Duck</h1>
    <p>
      Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and
      shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the same family. Divided among several subfamilies, they
      are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common
      ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be
      found in both fresh water and sea water.
