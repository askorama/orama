title: Performing hybrid search on Orama Cloud

After deploying your index, Orama will distribute it to over 300 global points of presence across more than 100 countries worldwide. This will guarantee the lowest possible latency for any search query, at any scale.

At the time of this writing, you can execute search queries using our official JavaScript SDK.

This SDK manages connection, cache, telemetry, and type-safety for all your search operations. It is the official method for communicating with Orama Cloud.

Make sure you have the Orama SDK installed to start performing vector search at the edge!

## What is hybrid search?

Hybrid search is a technique that merges full-text and vector search results into a unified list. It capitalizes on the strengths of both methods by balancing keyword-specific searches with the broader context of the overall query.

## Performing hybrid search

<Aside type="caution">
The following guide assumes that you have an **Open AI API key** set on Orama Cloud, as it is needed to perform transform text into embeddings at search time.
</Aside>

To perform a vector search with Orama Cloud, you need to populate an Orama index with vectors. Currently, this can be achieved through [automatic embeddings generation](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation) during the deployment process.

As an alternative, you can provide your own vectors while inserting new documents into an Orama index.

Once you have at least one index containing vectors, you can perform hybrid search by using the `search` function:

```ts
import { OramaClient } from "@oramacloud/client";

const client = new OramaClient({
  endpoint: "",
  api_key: "",
});

const vectorSearchResults = await client.search({
  term: "Super Mario videogame",
  mode: "hybrid",
  limit: 5, // How many results to return. Default is 10.
});
```

Orama will automatically convert your search term, for instance, `"Super Mario videogame"`, into an embedding using your OpenAI API Key. It will then search through your vectors and ultimately return the full documents in their original format.
