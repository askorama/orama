    <h1>Cat</h1>
    <p>
      The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in
      the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the
      family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human
      contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
