# Insert Data

Whenever we create a database with Orama, we must specify a `schema`, which
represents the entry we are going to index.

Let's say our database and schema look like this:

```javascript copy
import { create, insert } from '@orama/orama'

const movieDB = await create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    director: 'string',
    plot: 'string',
    year: 'number',
    isFavorite: 'boolean',
  },
})
```

(Read more about database creation on the [create](/open-source/usage/create) page)

## Insert

Data insertion in Orama is quick and intuitive:

```javascript copy
const thePrestigeId = await insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'The prestige',
  director: 'Christopher Nolan',
  plot: 'Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.',
  year: 2006,
  isFavorite: true,
});

const bigFishId = await insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'Big Fish',
  director: 'Tim Burton',
  plot: 'Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.',
  year: 2004,
  isFavorite: true,
});

const harryPotterId = await insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone',
  director: 'Chris Columbus',
  plot: 'Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.',
  year: 2001,
  isFavorite: false,
});
```

If you have a lot of records, we suggest using the `insertMultiple` function as following:

```javascript copy
const docs = [
  {
    title: 'The prestige',
    director: 'Christopher Nolan',
    plot: 'Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.',
    year: 2006,
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: 'Big Fish',
    director: 'Tim Burton',
    plot: 'Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.',
    year: 2004,
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone',
    director: 'Chris Columbus',
    plot: 'Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.',
    year: 2001,
    isFavorite: false,
  },
];

await insertMultiple(movieDB, docs);
```

Inserting a large number of documents in a loop could potentially block the event loop.
Instead `insertMultiple` handles this case better.

You can pass a third, optional, parameter to change the batch size (default:
`1000`). We recommend keeping this number as low as possible to avoid blocking
the event loop. The `batchSize` refers to the maximum number of `insert`
operations to perform before yielding the event loop.

```javascript
await insertMultiple(movieDB, docs, 500);
```

## Validation rules

Defining the schema at database creation time, Orama validates all the inserted documents following those rules:
- throw an error if a field has an unexpected type
- allow missing fields or fields set to `undefined`
- allow extra fields ignoring them

So the following document will be accepted:

```javascript copy
import { create, insert } from '@orama/orama'

const movieDB = await create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    year: 'number',
  },
})

await insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'The prestige',
  // `year` field is missing but it's ok
  // year: 2006,
  // Extra fields `director` and `isFavorite` will not be indexed
  director: 'Christopher Nolan',
  isFavorite: true,
});
```

## Custom document IDs

Orama automatically uses the `id` field of the document, if found.

That means that given the following document and schema:

```js
import { create, search } from '@orama/orama'

const db = await create({
  schema: {
    id: 'string',
    author: 'string',
    quote: 'string',
  },
})

await insert(db, {
  id: '73cbcc79-2203-49b8-bb52-60d8e9a66c5f',
  author: 'Fernando Pessoa',
  quote: "I wasn't meant for reality, but life came and found me",
})
```

the document will be indexed with the following `id`: `73cbcc79-2203-49b8-bb52-60d8e9a66c5f`.

<Callout type="info">If the `id` field is not found, Orama will generate a random `id` for the document.</Callout>

To provide a custom ID for a document, see the [components](/internals/components) page.

<Callout type="warning">If you try to insert two documents with the same ID, Orama will throw an error.</Callout>

## Remote document storing

By default Orama keeps a copy of the inserted document in memory (and in the serialized data) to speed up search performance.

If this is not acceptable, you can provide a custom `documentsStore` components which will be responsible to store
and fetch documents from another location (local or remote).

The code example below is an example that implements a proxy: when a document is requested, the code finds it on a location of the filesystem. 
We assume each document has an `id` field which disable Orama random ID generation.

You can replace the file related operations with your custom code.

```javascript copy
import { readFile, readdir, writeFile, rm } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { resolve } from 'node:path'
import { create } from '@orama/orama'

const ROOT_LOCATION = '/var/db/orama-example'

async function getDocument(id) {
  return JSON.parse(await readFile(resolve(ROOT_LOCATION, `${id}.json`), 'utf-8'))
}

async function listDocuments() {
  const allFiles = await readdir(ROOT_LOCATION)

  return allFiles.filter(id => id.endsWith('.json'))
}

const database = await create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    director: 'string',
  },
  components: {
    // override partially the default documents store
    documentsStore: {
      create() {
        return {}
      },
      load(raw) {
        return {}
      },
      save(store) {
        return {}
      },
      get(_, id) {
        return getDocument(id)
      },
      getMultiple(_, ids) {
        return Promise.all(
          ids.map(async id => {
            return JSON.parse(await getDocument(id))
          }),
        )
      },
      async getAll() {
        const docs = await listDocuments()

        return Promise.all(
          docs.map(async id => {
            return JSON.parse(await getDocument(id))
          }),
        )
      },
      store() {
        // No-op
      },
      remove() {
        // No-op
      },
      async count() {
        const docs = await listDocuments()

        return docs.count
      },
    },
  },
})
```
