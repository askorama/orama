# Stop-words

<Callout type="info">
  The words which are generally filtered out before processing a natural language are called **stop words**. These are
  actually the most common words in any language (like articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc) and does not
  add much information to the text. Examples of a few stop words in English are “the”, “a”, “an”, “so”, “what”.

Orama automatically removes common stop-words for you, depending on the `defaultLanguage` parameter used during new instance creation.

As for now, Orama supports 12 languages when it comes to stop-words removal:

- English (default)
- Italian
- French
- Spanish
- Portugaise
- Dutch
- Swedish
- Russian
- Norwegian
- German
- Danish
- Finnish

## Disabling stop-words removal

By default, `enableStopWords` is `true` but you can disable stop-words removal by setting `enableStopWords: false` when creating a new Orama instance:

```javascript
import { create } from '@orama/orama'

const db = await create({
  schema: {
    author: 'string',
    quote: 'string',
  },
  tokenizer: {
    enableStopWords: false,
  },
})
```

## Customizing stop-words

You can interact with the default Orama stop-words by using the built-in `customStopWords` property when creating a new Orama instance:

```javascript
import { create } from '@orama/orama'

const db = await create({
  schema: {
    author: 'string',
    quote: 'string',
  },
  tokenizer: {
    customStopWords: defaultStopWords => [...defaultStopWords, 'foo', 'bar'],
  },
})
```
