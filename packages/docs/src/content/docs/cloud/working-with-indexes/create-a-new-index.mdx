Creating a new index is extremely simple.

If that's your first time creating an index on Orama Cloud, you will see the following screen:

  alt='First-time welcome screen on Orama Cloud'
/>

Here, you can select the type of index you want to create.

You have the option to import a file (either JSON or CSV), connect to an e-commerce platform (we currently support Shopify and Elasticpath, with more native integrations coming soon), or implement a custom integration by connecting your Orama Index to a REST APIs or remote JSON.

For this guide, we will use a JSON file. You can follow along using [this](/cloud/guides/example-datasets/games.json) dataset.

Click on "Import from files", and complete the next screen as you prefer:

Once you click on "Create index", Orama will create an empty index for you:

  alt='Empty Orama index'
/>

Here you can upload a JSON file, and Orama will show you a preview of the first document found in it.

You can use this information to write the searchable properties schema:

Remember that you can only perform search and filter through properties that are present in the search schema.

To make Orama faster, read the [Optimizing Orama: Schema Optimization](https://askorama.com/blog/optimizing-orama-schema-optimization) article on our blog.

Now you only need to determine if you want to perform vector/hybrid search on your index using Orama embedding models or OpenAI ones. Refer to [this guide](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation#automatic-embeddings-generation) to learn more about this feature.

If you're unsure about which model to use, we recommend using the Orama embeddings, as they are free, faster, and more optimized than OpenAI's.

Orama GTE-small are the default embedding model, and we highly recommend using them for most use cases. If you need more powerful embeddings, you can use the Orama GTE-medium or GTE-large models, as well as OpenAI's ones.

Once you selected the properties to generate the embeddings from, click on "Save and deploy" to release your index.

After the deployment process is finished, you'll be able to see an endpoint and a public API key. You can use these two parameters for performing search using the [Orama Client SDK](/cloud/integrating-orama-cloud/javascript-sdk).

To update your index, simply upload a new JSON file with the same schema (or edit the schema accordingly with your new data ) and click on "Save and deploy" again.
