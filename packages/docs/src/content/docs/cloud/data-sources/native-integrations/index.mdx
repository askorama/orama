Orama Cloud offers a rich variety of Native integrations and plugins that helps you integrate with your app with ease. When available, we suggest using native integrations over custom integrations, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

If your platform is not listed, you can always build a [custom integration](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations) using [REST APIs](/cloud/data-sources/custom-integrations/rest-apis).

At the time of writing this, we have the following plugins:

<br />

<ShowcaseImage
  entries={[
    {
      thumbnail: import('../../../../../assets/data-sources/docusaurus.jpg'),
      href: '/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/docusaurus',
      title: 'Docusaurus',
      description: 'Install a plugin to index your static site contents.',
    },
    {
      thumbnail: import('../../../../../assets/data-sources/shopify.jpg'),
      href: '/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/shopify',
      title: 'Shopify',
      description: 'Connect your Shopify store to Orama Cloud.',
    },
    {
      thumbnail: import('../../../../../assets/data-sources/strapi.jpg'),
      href: '/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/strapi',
      title: 'Strapi',
      description: 'Integrate Orama Cloud with your Strapi CMS.',
    },
    {
      thumbnail: import('../../../../../assets/data-sources/elastic-path.jpg'),
      href: '/cloud/data-sources/native-integrations/elasticpath',
      title: 'Elasticpath',
      description: 'Connect your Elasticpath shop to Orama Cloud.',
    },
  ]}
/>

When available, we always suggest using **native integrations** over **custom integrations**, as they are highly optimized and provide a better developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

We're working on adding more plugins, so if you have any suggestions...<br />please let us know at [info@orama.com](mailto:info@orama.com).
