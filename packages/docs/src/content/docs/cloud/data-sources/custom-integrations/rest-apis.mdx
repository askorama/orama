REST APIs provide an effective means of interacting with your Orama index.

They allow you to update, insert, and remove data from your index seamlessly. The system then queues these changes until you request a redeploy.

This guide will show you how to utilize the Orama REST APIs for deploying and managing an index on Orama Cloud.

## Creating an index and feeding it via REST APIs

Firstly, create a new index using "REST API" as a data source. You can find it under "custom data sources."

After creating it, you will need to construct the searchable properties schema. Remember, only include the properties you plan to use for searching or filtering.

If you have questions about optimizing your Orama schema and its impact on search performance, refer to [this blog post](https://askorama.com/blog/optimizing-orama-schema-optimization) on schema optimization.

For this guide, we will use a very simple schema, which consists of two simple properties: `"name"` (of type `string`) and `"age"` (of type `number`).

We will also enable [automatic embeddings generation](/cloud/orama-ai/automatic-embeddings-generation), so that we can perform vector and hybrid search on this index:

  alt='REST APIs index schema'
/>

After we complete this step, we can save the configuration by clicking on "Save".

This will bring us to the following screen, where we can find some instructions on how to deploy and update an index via REST APIs:

<img
  src='/cloud/guides/webhook/instruction.png'
  alt='REST APIs instructions'
/>

From here, we can choose two different ways of updating an index.

To run the following APIs, get an Orama API Key in the [developers tools section](https://cloud.orama.com/developer-tools) of the dashboard.

## Inserting a snapshot

A snapshot is a complete override of a given index. It means you bulk upload a number of documents, which entirely substitute the live index all at once.

For example, if you want your live index to only contains the two following documents:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "age": 25
  }
]
```

You can use the **snapshot** API to bulk update the live index:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { CloudManager } from '@oramacloud/client'

    const oramaCloudManager = new CloudManager({
      api_key: process.env.ORAMA_CLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
    })

    const myIndex = oramaCloudManager.index('my-index-id')

    await myIndex.snapshot([
      { id: 1, name: "John Doe", age: 30 },
      { id: 2, name: "Jane Doe", age: 25 },
    ])
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.oramasearch.com/api/v1/webhooks/$INDEX_ID/snapshot \
      -H "authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_API_KEY" ]
      -d '[ { "id": "1", "name": "John Doe", "age": 30 }, { "id": "2", "name": "Jane Doe", "age": 25 } ]'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Updating, removing, inserting elements in a live index

While the **snapshot** API is convenient for replacing a live index with a new one, there may be instances where you only want to update one or more documents, or perhaps insert and delete others.

This is where the **notify** API becomes really convenient.

Let's say you want to add a new document:

```json
{
  "id": "3",
  "name": "Rick Morty",
  "age": 80
}
```

you can use the **notify** API to put that operation in queue for the next deployment:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { CloudManager } from '@oramacloud/client'

    const oramaCloudManager = new CloudManager({
      api_key: process.env.ORAMA_CLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
    })

    const myIndex = oramaCloudManager.index('my-index-id')

    await myIndex.insert([{ id: "3", name: "Rick Morty", age: 80 }])
    await myIndex.update([{ id: "3", name: "Rick Doe", age: 75 }])
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.oramasearch.com/api/v1/webhooks/$INDEX_ID/notify \
      -H "authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_API_KEY" \
      -d '{ "upsert": [{ "id": "3", "name": "Rick Morty", "age": 80 }] }'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

as you can see, you'll need to pass an array of objects to an `upsert` operation (will do that based on the `id` field). If Orama find that document, it will update it, otherwise it will insert a new one.

You can always remove an existing document by using the `remove` operation. For example, this is how you can remove the document with id `"2"`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { CloudManager } from '@oramacloud/client'

    const oramaCloudManager = new CloudManager({
      api_key: process.env.ORAMA_CLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
    })

    const myIndex = oramaCloudManager.index('my-index-id')

    await myIndex.remove(["2"])
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.oramasearch.com/api/v1/webhooks/$INDEX_ID/notify \
      -H "authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_API_KEY" \
      -d '{ "remove": ["2"] }'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Deploying the index

After you have inserted a snapshot or put a number of insert, remove, or update operations in the queue, you have to deploy a new version of the index.

You can easily do that via the deploy API:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { CloudManager } from '@oramacloud/client'

    const oramaCloudManager = new CloudManager({
      api_key: process.env.ORAMA_CLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
    })

    const myIndex = oramaCloudManager.index('my-index-id')

    await myIndex.deploy()
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.oramasearch.com/api/v1/webhooks/$INDEX_ID/deploy \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_API_KEY"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will trigger a new deployment and will make the new index available worldwide in just a few minutes.

## Clearing the index on next deployment

Sometimes, you may want to re-insert all the documents in the index, and to do that, you will first need to tell Orama to clear the index on the next deployment.

You can do that by using the `clear` API, or by creating an empty snapshot:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { CloudManager } from '@oramacloud/client'

    const oramaCloudManager = new CloudManager({
      api_key: process.env.ORAMA_CLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
    })

    const myIndex = oramaCloudManager.index('my-index-id')

    await myIndex.clear()
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.oramasearch.com/api/v1/webhooks/$INDEX_ID/snapshot \
      -H "authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_API_KEY" ]
      -d '[]'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will clear the index on the next deployment, and you can then insert a new snapshot or a number of operations to update the index. This ensures that old data is not present in the index anymore.

## Check if there are pending operations

If you lost track of the operatiosn you ran via the SDK or APIs, you can always check if there are pending operations in the queue by using the `hasPendingOperations` API:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import { CloudManager } from '@oramacloud/client'

    const oramaCloudManager = new CloudManager({
      api_key: process.env.ORAMA_CLOUD_PRIVATE_API_KEY,
    })

    const myIndex = oramaCloudManager.index('my-index-id')

    const hasPendingOperations = await myIndex.hasPendingOperations()
    console.log(hasPendingOperations)
    // true or false
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="cURL">
    ```bash
    # Beware: this API will be renamed to "/has-pending-operations" in the future.
    # We recommend using the SDK instead.
    curl https://api.oramasearch.com/api/v1/webhooks/$INDEX_ID/has-data \
      -H "authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_API_KEY" ]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
