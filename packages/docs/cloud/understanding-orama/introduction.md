# Understanding Orama Cloud

Orama Cloud brings **Orama** to the next level.

In just a few minutes, you can deploy a new [Orama index](/cloud/understanding-orama/indexes) to **300** global locations in **100** countries all over the world. This allows Orama to be extremely fast, resilient, and scalable.

Orama Cloud, based on Orama, is an open-source full-text and vector search engine. It is entirely written in TypeScript without any dependencies.

Its numerous features include:

- Full-text search
- Vector search
- Hybrid search
- Answer sessions
- Stemming and tokenizing in 30 languages
- Geosearch
- Query filters
- Facets
- Groups
- Custom sorting rules
- A robust plugin system
- Fields boosting
- Typo tolerance
- Customizable BM25

And much more.

## Understaning the concept of indexes

Orama is an immutable search engine, which means that once your indexes are deployed, they remain unchanged until the next deployment.

But what is an index? And how can you update it while in production? Find out in [the next section](/cloud/understanding-orama/indexes).
